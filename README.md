# Java EE 8 Recipes - Book Sources
Sources for the book "Java EE 8 Recipes", Apress.

To use these sources, you must first create a database into which the schema can be loaded.  These sources contain SQL scripts
that will work for the Apache Derby or Oracle databases.  Since the schema in these examples contains a user of "acme", a 
database name of "acme" makes sense.

## Projects

The main project for the book is entitled JavaEE8Recipes.  This project contains the majority of the source code that is used for the recipe examples throughout the book.
